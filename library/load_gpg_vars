module: load_gpg_vars
short_description: Load host variables from a PGP-encrypted YAML file
description:
  - Decrypts and reads host variables from a PGP-encrypted YAML file.
    The YAML file is expected to be a YAML associative array mapping
    variables to their values.  Each variable is set as a host
    variable on every host this module is run against.
  - "One name is special: if a C(hosts) key is found, it is expected
    to have an associative array beneath it, the keys of which are
    host names and the values of which are themselves associative
    arrays of variables to be set on that specific host.  This allows
    setting variables on specific hosts, though note that only the
    hosts you run this module against will be affected regardless of
    the contents of the C(hosts) key."
  - "C(gpg) is used to decrypt the file.  In theory either version 1
    or version 2 will work, though this module has mostly been tested
    with version 2.  You may want to use C(gpg-agent) to prompt for
    your passphrase, and also to cache your passphrase so that you
    don't have to retype it every time you run this module."
